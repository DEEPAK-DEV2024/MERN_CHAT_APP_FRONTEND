# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
# Chat App

This is a real-time chat application built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) with **WebSocket** for real-time communication, and **Tailwind CSS** for responsive design.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Messaging**: Implemented using WebSocket to enable instant communication between users.
- **Responsive UI**: Built with Tailwind CSS for a mobile-friendly and fast interface.
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used for secure authentication.
- **MERN Stack**: Utilizes MongoDB for database management, Express.js and Node.js for the backend, and React for the frontend.
- **MongoDB Atlas**: Hosted on MongoDB Atlas, a cloud-based NoSQL database service.
- **State Management**: React hooks and context for efficient state management.
- **WebSocket**: For real-time data transfer between client and server.
